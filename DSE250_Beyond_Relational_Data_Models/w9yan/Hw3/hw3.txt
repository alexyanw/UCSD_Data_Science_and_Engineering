1. Find persons who served as both actor and director in the same movie (display person name and movie title).
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name, m.title

2. Find the name of directors who have never acted.
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie) WHERE NOT (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie) RETURN DISTINCT p.name

3. For each person who has acted in at least one movie, add a label "Actor" to the node representing this person.
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie) SET p:Actor

4. For each actor, add a "roleCount" attribute containing the number of roles the actor has interpreted overall.
MATCH (a:Person)-[act:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
WITH a,count(act.roles) AS roleCount
set a.roleCount = roleCount

5. For each director, find the number of roles they have directed (display director name and role number).
MATCH (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)<-[act:ACTED_IN]-(p)
UNWIND act.roles AS act_role
RETURN d.name as director, SIZE(COLLECT(DISTINCT act_role)) AS roleNumber
ORDER BY roleNumber DESC

6. Find the name of actors who have worked with every director born after 1966.
MATCH (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)
WHERE d.born > 1966
WITH COLLECT(DISTINCT d) AS directors
MATCH (:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WHERE ALL(d in directors WHERE (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a))
RETURN distinct a.name AS actor

7. Rename each ACTED_IN relation to APPEARED_IN, preserve the "roles" attribute.
MATCH (p:Person)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
CREATE (p)-[r:APPEARED_IN {roles:a.roles}]->(m)
DELETE a
